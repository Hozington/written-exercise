Hi Joe,

Thank you for reaching out to RelyComply.

We reviewed your initial requirement and we require clarifications. We put together a set of questions that we would like you to go through. Answers to the below questions will be used to ensure that the solution that we will build is stable, scalable and remains within budget.

> 1. How many parties are involved in the transaction process from the moment a purchase is made to when it is settled? (Transaction flow)
> 
> 2. Who are the parties that are involved in the transaction flows?
> 
> 3. Please list the steps that make up the transaction flows and clearly indicate the party that is involved in the step and their responsibility. Please include all possible permutations.
> 
> 4. How many transactions do you expect the application to handle per minute, hour, day and week?
> 
> 5. Will the average number of transactions increase drastically at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week? If yes, please provide more information such as days or a range of hours.
> 
> 6. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being critical, how critical is it for the transactions to reflect immediately? Can the system be updated at night or would you prefer for it to be updated in real-time? **Please note that real-time updates will require more work, this will result in both teams experiencing delays while developing the solution and it may result in a budget cap breach.**

We are loooking forward to working with you so please reach out if you are unsure of anything.

Regards,
